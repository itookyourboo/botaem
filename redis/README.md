Assignment: Advanced Redis Implementation for Middle Backend Developers
---

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to implement advanced features and optimizations using Redis, an in-memory data structure store. Redis is widely used for caching, session management, and real-time data processing. This assignment will challenge your skills in leveraging Redis's advanced functionalities to build a high-performance backend system.

## Requirements

1. Install Redis: Set up Redis on your local machine or use a cloud-based Redis service.
2. Configuration: Configure Redis to listen on a custom port (e.g., 6380) and modify any necessary settings for performance optimization.
3. Data Storage and Retrieval:
    * Implement a function to store a blog post in Redis. The function should take the blog post ID and content as input and store them as a hash data structure in Redis.
    * Implement a function to retrieve a blog post from Redis based on its ID.
    * Implement a function to delete a blog post from Redis based on its ID.
4. Indexing and Searching:
   * Implement a function to index the blog posts' content using Redis's Sorted Sets. Each word in the blog post's content should be a member of a Sorted Set, with its score representing the occurrence frequency.
   * Implement a function to search for blog posts based on a given keyword. The function should return a list of blog post IDs ranked by relevance to the keyword.
5. Expiration:
   * Implement a function to set an expiration time for a blog post in Redis. The function should take the blog post ID and expiration time in seconds as input and set the expiration for that key accordingly.
   * Ensure that expired blog posts are automatically removed from Redis.
6. Data Retrieval:
   * Implement a function to retrieve all blog posts stored in Redis.
   * Implement a function to retrieve the total count of blog posts stored in Redis.
7. Caching and Invalidations:
   * Implement a caching mechanism using Redis for frequently accessed blog posts. Whenever a blog post is retrieved, it should be cached in Redis. Subsequent requests for the same blog post should first check the cache before fetching the data from the database or any other persistent storage.
   * Implement a function to invalidate the cache for a specific blog post. This function should be called whenever a blog post is updated or deleted.
8. Pub/Sub:
   * Implement a pub/sub mechanism using Redis. Whenever a new blog post is created, publish a message to a specific channel. Subscribers should receive the message containing the blog post ID and content.
   * Implement a subscriber that listens to the channel and logs the received blog post information.
9. Transactions:
   * Implement a transaction to ensure atomicity when updating a blog post's content and its associated indexes.
   * Rollback the transaction if any operation fails within the transaction.
10. Performance Optimization:
    * Explore and implement Redis's features like pipelining, batch commands, and Lua scripting to optimize the performance of data storage and retrieval operations.

## Bonus Points (Optional)

* Implement pagination for retrieving blog posts in batches.
* Implement rate limiting using Redis's built-in functionalities.
* Explore Redis modules or extensions and integrate them into your implementation.

## Guidelines

* Use a programming language of your choice for the backend application (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).
* Use a Redis client library suitable for your chosen programming language.
* Write clean and maintainable code with proper error handling.
* Include clear instructions on how to run the application and any dependencies required.
* Provide performance metrics and benchmarks to showcase the improvements achieved through optimizations.
* Note: Feel free to add any additional features or optimizations to enhance the Redis implementation further.
